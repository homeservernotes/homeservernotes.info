## Overview
The group met on zoom.  Five people attended.   

## Topics
* Comparison of proxmox and yunohost

* Discussion of [traefik](https://traefik.io) and reverse proxies in general.   A reverse proxy runs on a server and directs incoming traffic (ingress) to the appropriate service according to the URL used to reach the reverse proxy.

* The docker image for the [proxmox/terraform demo](https://github.com/dmbrownlee/demo-proxmox-terraform) has been updated.

* We talked about the current status of the windows/truenas permissions problem that we discussed last week.   These have been mostly resolved.

* A participant gave an overview of what [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is and how to use it.  Ansible is a configuration manager that (typically) runs on a computer other than the one being configured.   Ansible uses ssh to run python on the target machine and configure as needed.
